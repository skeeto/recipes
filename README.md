# My Personal Cooking Recipes

This a collection of recipes I cook regularly, tweaked to my personal
tastes. Since I cannot always remember every quantity, it serves as a
durable reference. Also, recipe websites today are generally terrible, and
I hate visiting them to look up recipes I've forgotten.

Most quantities are inexact, and the exact amount depends on the amount on
hand or simply an estimate. Some recipes will include references to
original source recipes, or simply videos demonstrating technique
difficult to convey with text. References recipes are likely to differ.

The recipes require only a basic kitchen configuration: stove, microwave
oven, spatulas, knives, cutting board, pizza slicer, pots, pans, mixing
bowls, rolling pin, whisk, can opener, measuring cups/spoons, grater, and
a counter top. Just as with programming, I try avoid to relying on fancy,
specialized tools. However, I strongly recommend a kitchen scale. In many
cases it's more precise, easier, and less messy than measuring cups. It
also helps with portioning the results.

My wife and I stopped eating out in the spring of 2020, initially for the
obvious reason, but continued since it's much cheaper and healthier. The
recipes here make up a significant portion of our diet. The rest is my
wife's recipes, which I haven't yet included.
