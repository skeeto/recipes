# Blueberry "Muffin" Scones

Muffin wrappers are annoying, so this "muffin" recipe shapes them as
scones. As a bonus, the entire muffin has the texture and taste of a
muffin top, which is the best part anyway.

* 1c sugar
* 0.5c butter
* 2 eggs
* 2tbsp vegetable oil
* 2tbsp lemon juice
* 1c sour cream
* 3c flour
* 1tbsp baking powder
* 0.5tsp baking soda
* 1tsp salt
* 2c blueberries

Cream the butter and sugar, then mix in the rest of the wet ingredients.
In another bowl, mix the dry ingredients. Add half the dry bowl into the
wet bowl and mix. Preheat the oven to 375F. Add the blueberries and the
remainder of the dry bowl, then mix until it just comes together.

Scoop out 9 to 16 lumps of batter onto baking sheets. Lumps will spread
out while baking, so leave plenty of room. Bake for 30 minutes, or until
the top has browned like a muffin. Set out to cool and dry. Tastes best
after cooled, not fresh out of the oven.
