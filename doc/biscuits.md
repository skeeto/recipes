# Wellons Biscuits

* 500g (~4c) of all purpose flour 
* 4tsp baking powder
* 2tsp salt
* 1c (2 sticks) butter
* 1.25c buttermilk

Unwrap butter and place in freezer for 30-60 minutes. Thoroughly mix dry
ingredients in a large bowl using a whisk. Chilling the dry ingredients
in the fridge while the butter is freezing can help with forming the
biscuits later.

If lacking buttermilk, stir 1tbsp of vinegar into some milk and let sit
for at least 10-15 minutes. Lacking milk, powdered milk works well. In
the worst case water also works, but the biscuits will be slightly less
flavorful.

When the butter is ready, begin pre-heating oven to 410F. Shred the cold
butter into the large bowl, tossing in the flour with a fork as needed
to keep the butter from sticking to itself.

Using a spatula, slowly combine buttermilk into the large bowl until the
flour is *just barely* absorbed. If a bit more liquid is needed, but not
enough buttermilk is available or prepared, water is fine. Better to use
too little liquid than too much since more can be added later.

Empty crumbly bowl contents onto lightly-floured countertop, squeeze
together into a dough, then roll out like a pie crust. Cut in half and
stack. Cut in half again and stack. Roll out the stack and repeat
rolling and cutting several times to build layers. Sprinkle flour on the
countertop and dough as needed to prevent sticking. Finally work into a
1-inch thick square, cut into 16 equal smaller squares, place squares on
parchment paper on a baking sheet.

Bake for 18 minutes. Broil an additional 1 minute to crisp the tops and
edges. Move baked biscuits to a cooling rack to allow excess moisture to
escape. Let rest for at least a few minutes, then dig in. The biscuits
keep for at least several days in a sealed container. Cold leftovers go
well with jam or jelly.

With 16 biscuits, each will be 200 calores.
