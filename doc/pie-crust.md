# Pie Crust

Makes two pie crusts, i.e. a top and a bottom.

* 12oz flour (~2.5c)
* 1c (2 sticks) butter
* 0.5tsp salt
* 7tbsp water
* 1tbsp vinegar

Unwrap butter and place in freezer for 30-60 minutes. Mix try ingredients
in a large bowl. Shred the cold butter into the large bowl, tossing in the
flour with a fork as needed to keep the butter from sticking to itself.

Gradually combine liquid, stirring and absorbing into the flour. Empty the
bowl onto a lightly-floured counter top, and squeeze the crumbly dough
into solid ball. Split the dough into two halves, shape into a small disk,
wrap with plastic wrap, and chill in the fridge at least 30 minutes before
use.
