# Meatloaf with Onion

* 2lbs ground beef
* 1 large yellow onion
* 2 large eggs
* 0.75c breadcrumbs
* 0.25c ketchup
* 0.5c water

Dice onion and sauté in a little oil until caramelized. Set aside to cool.

Preheat oven to 350F. Whisk together eggs, breadcrumbs, ketchup, and
water. Stir in cooled onion. Gradually combine beef with a spatula until
just combined. Avoid overworking it. Distribute mixture into two 8" x 4"
loaf pans.

Bake for ~65 minutes. Broil 2–3 additional minutes to create a crust.
Lightly salt when serving. Makes 4–6 servings.

Scale up or down to match the quantity of ground beef on hand. Above 3
lbs, consider introducing more pans in order to keep the loaf relatively
shallow. The crust-to-meat ratio should remain high.
