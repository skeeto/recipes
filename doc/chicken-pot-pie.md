# Chicken Pot Pie

The ultimate comfort food.

![](chicken-pot-pie.jpg)

* 2tbps butter
* 1 bag frozen peas
* chopped carrots
* chopped onion
* 2c (1 can) chicken broth
* 0.5c heavy cream
* ~1.5lbs boneless, skinless chicken
* 0.25c flour
* 1 egg, whisked

Dice chicken into ~1-inch cubes. Heat butter in a pan, add salt, onions
carrots, and saute. Add chicken, brown, and caramelize a bit to the pan.
Add flour and cook for a few minutes. Add broth, peas, and cream, then
reduce to desired thickness while aggressively scraping the bottom of the
pan.

Remove from heat to cool slightly, roll out a pie crust, and place it into
a pie pan. Fill the pie, then cover with second pie crust. Crimp, cut
vents, and brush some of the egg over the top crust. Bake at 425F for
30â€“35 minutes.

With 8 slices, each slice will be around 600 calories. Goes *very* well
with my biscuits, which act as additional crust to soak up the excess
filling.
