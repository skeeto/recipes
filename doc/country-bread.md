# Country Bread

The flour makes a big difference in the result, so if it doesn't turn out
well, try a different brand of flour. The bread is best when fresh and is
great when hosting guests. However, it quickly looses quality over 2â€“3
days, then it begins molding, so eat it quickly.

* 650g bread flour
* 0.25tsp yeast
* 2c water
* 1.5tsp salt

Whisk the flour, salt, and yeast together dry in a large bowl. Gradually
add water, mixing and scraping with a spatula. Cover and let rise in a
turned-off oven for around 18 hours. The long rise means it no kneading is
required.

After rising it will be bubbly with a strong fermentation smell. Use a
spatula to scrap away from the surface, folding over itself, making
several passes around the bowl. Empty onto a well-floured surface, and
split into two halves. Roll and fold each until it has a nice skin, place
each separately on a pan, and let rise an additional 2 hours. Then bake at
450F for 30 minutes, producing two loaves.
